        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In Dishonored 2 During the mission in Dunwall in the bar you can see a large board with a note about the recipe of a gin-based drink.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, this note also appears in several other locations. From one of them we can read that they also drink it in hot version, if they like the customer who requests it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gin</li>
            <li>Cane Sugar</li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
            <li>Ice Cube(not the rapper)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Gin and Sugar</h3>
                <p>Pour a teaspoon of sugar into a glass and pour a portion of gin. Mix until sugar dissolves.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Ice and Nutmeg</h3>
                <p>Pour a handful of ice into the glass. Top with a fresh nutmeg (finely grated)</p>
                <p>you can use a ground nutmeg from a packet, but fresh is more aromatic.</p>
